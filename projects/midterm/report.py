# %% [markdown]
# For this project, I decided to write a TX/RX pair that implements most
# of IEEE Std 802.11a-1999's physical (PHY) layer, specifically the
# Physical layer Protocol Data Unit (PPDU) frame format. On top of this,
# I've taken the liberty of writing a Viterbi hard-decision decoder for
# the receiver along with various unit tests to ensure that each of the
# sub-components of the TX/RX pair behave as expected.
